> While working with IBM, [Taiwanese American engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur Chan Yeh] dedicated his
> spare time to exploring an entirely different venture—the electronic processing of Chinese characters. He
> felt convinced it should be possible to digitize Chinese characters, and thereby bring Chinese writing
> into the computer age. Yeh nicknamed his side-venture “Iron Eagle,” on account of the Chinese characters
> that he first digitized: ying (eagle) and tie (iron).

> “Iron Eagle” immediately caught the attention of Taiwanese brass. Taiwan’s Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested
> that Yeh quit IBM, and focus on the project full-time. Yeh agreed and attempted to resign, but was
> convinced by IBM to take a sabbatical year instead, during which he could focus on his side project with
> greater concentration.
>
> Yeh took a one-year leave of absence from IBM in 1971, serving as a visiting professor of applied
> mathematics and nuclear engineering at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. The following year, he
> founded a company called Ideographix, opening its doors in Sunnyvale, California, in one of the earliest
> buildings to be built in Silicon Valley. Yeh would serve as its president and chief engineer, with his
> brother, Chan Jong (“CJ”), as vice president.
>
> The flagship product of Ideographix was the IPX, a computerized phototypesetting system that would change
> Chinese printing forever.

> For roughly the first seven years of its existence, “Iron Eagle”—now renamed IPX—was limited to use by the
> Taiwanese and American militaries. Two of Yeh’s first major non-military clients were Taiwan’s
> Telecommunication Administration and the National Tax Administration of Taipei. For the former,
> Ideographix helped process and transmit millions of phone bills, and dramatically reduced the time needed
> to produce telephone directories. For the latter, IPX enabled the production of tax return documents on an
> incomparable scale.
>
> Yeh began to be approached by media outlets, including one of Taiwan’s largest daily newspapers, United
> Daily News (Lianhebao). At this newspaper, an immense labor force of perhaps as many as 400 typesetters
> spent all evening setting type for the daily edition. With the introduction of the IPX system, this labor
> force was reduced to a mere 50, who could suddenly do the job in far less time.
>
> Exploiting this added speed, United Daily News was able to wait longer until going to press, closing the
> day’s news cycle at 2 am, as compared to competitors who went to press in the late evening. This enabled
> the paper to scoop its rivals, with a morning edition that included news that broke too late for other
> papers to cover.
